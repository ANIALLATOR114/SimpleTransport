# Sql Scripts

This directory contains all the SQL scripts that should be run in order to create the database schema for CI runs.

The scripts will be run in the order of the filenames, so it is important to name the files in the order that they should be run.

The convention is to name the files with a number prefix, followed by a description of what the script does. For example, `001_create_schema.sql` would be the first script to run, and `002_create_table.sql` would be the second.
