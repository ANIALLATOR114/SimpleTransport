        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p class="dense-text">
            SimplyTransport is constantly growing, with new features being added
            regularly. It provides an API for accessing formatted GTFS data, with the
            ability to query specific subsets of data. This functionality is not
            available in the limited government APIs. Additional data models have also
            been defined to make working with the datasets more accessible.
